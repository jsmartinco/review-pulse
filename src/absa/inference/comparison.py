The builder is Streamlit-free and receives its predictor factory by injection, so
the interface can supply its cached, lock-guarded loader while tests supply
fakes. Models are evaluated sequentially: the shared predictors are not safe to
run in parallel, and the comparison is small enough that sequencing is not a
